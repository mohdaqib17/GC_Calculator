# GC-Calculator
This tool allows you to calculate the GC content of nucleotide sequences stored in FASTA files. 

# Overview
The FASTA File GC Content Calculator is a Python-based tool that calculates the GC content of nucleotide sequences stored in FASTA files. GC content, the percentage of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) bases in a DNA sequence, is an important metric in bioinformatics for various analyses, including primer design, sequence comparison, and molecular biology experiments.

# Features
File Selection: Select a FASTA file containing nucleotide sequences.
GC Content Calculation: Compute the GC content of each sequence in the FASTA file.
Percentage Display: Present the GC content as a percentage for easy interpretation.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using Tkinter.

# How to Use
1) Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone https://github.com/mohdaqib17/GC_Calculator.git

2) Run the Application: Execute the Python script gc_content_calculator.py:

python gc_content_calculator.py

3) Select FASTA File: Click the "Import" button to choose a FASTA file.

# Notes
Ensure your FASTA file follows the standard format with sequence headers starting with ">".
Non-standard characters in the sequences will be ignored during computation.
For large files or files with multiple sequences, the computation may take longer.
This tool is provided for educational and research purposes only and may not be suitable for high-throughput analysis.
